Turns out, I do need a blog, and it also turns out having backups of my blog posts is a good idea. So here we are.

That said, this particular recreation of this blog will be done using the Wayback machine because I *actually* can't find my old svbtle hosted blog backups. Glad I was worthy for the archiving, Internet Archive

I'll post the old stuff as I determine its suitability for the Internet.
