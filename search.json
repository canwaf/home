    "text": "roughdata is a reality experienced by data anlysts, scientists, and engineers. To make our work work, we make assumptions before we get to the fun stuff. We are not perfect, and we’re not always right. But all analysis is iterative. We can always go back and fix things to make things better.\nWe can also have fun with other people’s models. I haven’t done much of creating generative AI models; however I’ve had a lot of fun with StableDiffusion and ChatGPT. I talk about ChatGPT making my life a bit easier on Mastodon.\n\nChatGPT by OpenAI fun\nI don’t have a cat, but I certainly enjoy throwing pet related questions at ChatGPT. This is a sample of level of nonsense I’m willing to put out into the world. Not quite proud of this, but certainly it’s an index placeholder for the blog and about me pages.\n\nChatGPT provides a product brief for luxury catnip tea\nandrew fergusson:\n\nGive me a product benefits list for a brand of cold brew catnip tea for cats available as a subscription.\n\nOpenAI ChatGPT:\n\n\nContains 100% organic catnip, providing a safe and natural source of stimulation for cats.\nCold brewing process preserves the natural oils in the catnip, resulting in a stronger aroma and taste.\nAvailable as a subscription service, ensuring a regular supply of fresh tea.\nConveniently packaged in single-serving sachets, allowing for easy portion control.\nHelps to promote healthy digestion and can provide a calming effect.\nCan aid in providing relief from anxiety and stress.\nA great way to bond with your cat and provide them with a stimulating and enjoyable activity.\nEnvironmentally friendly, packaged with minimal waste.\nCan be served as a treat or as a complement to their regular meals.\nMade with high-quality ingredients, ensuring the safety and satisfaction of your cat.\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT delivers a convocation speech for the business school\nOddly, this one provided more personality than the presiding dean. But bless the University of Sheffield for plouging through 200 awards in an hour. Certainly faster, though the content wasn’t as interesting, as my experience with Open Unversity and now Dr. Ronan Keating on 16 May 2022.\nandrew fergusson:\n\nWrite a 5 minute commencement speech to be given by a chancellor of University of Sheffield.\n\nOpenAI ChatGPT:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, graduates, friends, and family, it is my honor to stand before you today as the chancellor of the University of Sheffield. As we gather to celebrate the accomplishments of our graduates, I want to take a moment to reflect on the journey that has brought us here.\nFirstly, I want to congratulate each and every one of you on this incredible achievement. You have worked hard, overcome obstacles, and reached this momentous occasion. You should be incredibly proud of yourselves, and I want to express my deep admiration for your dedication and perseverance.\nAs you go out into the world, I want to remind you of the importance of continued learning and growth. You may have completed your time at the University of Sheffield, but the true education is only just beginning. The world is constantly changing, and it is up to you to adapt, learn, and grow as individuals.\nYou will face challenges, and you will make mistakes, but that is the beauty of life. Embrace the unknown, take risks, and most importantly, never stop learning.\nSecondly, I would like to remind you of the importance of community and connection. The University of Sheffield has been your home for the past few years, and you have formed connections and relationships that will last a lifetime. The support and camaraderie you have experienced here will be invaluable as you navigate the complexities of the world.\nSo, my dear graduates, I urge you to keep these connections strong and to seek out new ones. The world is a better place when we work together, and I have no doubt that you will make a positive impact on those around you.\nLastly, I would like to say that I am incredibly proud to be the chancellor of the University of Sheffield and I am honored to have had the opportunity to be a part of your journey. You are a testament to the excellence and potential of this institution, and I have no doubt that you will go on to do great things.\nCongratulations again on this incredible achievement, and I wish you all the best as you embark on the next chapter of your lives. Thank you."

    "text": "tl;dr the swipe based interactions on the Phone App for modifying incline on treadmill workouts is not safe and needs to be reimagined, ideally with a calculator button-style instant incline set option.\nBackground: A lot of my running at the moment is within the confines of a HIIT class (Barry’s Bootcamp), mainly to address my resistance training and improve core stability. Approximately half the class is on a treadmill regardless. The Treadmills are a Woodway make, and their user interface looks like the photo below. Speed on the right (miles per hour), incline on the left (percentage incline). There are also ways of modifying each single-press speed change by 0.1 units in two locations on the treads.\n\nJust to describe how to use the interface. You press 5 on the left side (Numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15), the treadmill blinks into action and begins increasing or decreasing the incline to the desired percentage incline. If you press 10 on the right side, the treadmill begins increasing or decreasing the speed to 10 miles per hour (Buttons are integers 0 to 12). A single button press is all that is required.\nHere’s what it looks like with the swipe interface on using the Stryd app on iOS.\nVideo link to video\nAt timestamp 1:40 my troubles really become apparent where I’m belting out the speed (sub 4 minute kilometres on an incline), but having to fight with the interface. Tapping the down button risks you swiping away the incline options, tapping anywhere risks just jiggling the interface and not registering the tap\nI know Stryd has structured incline runs for Treadmills. It’s a cool feature, and is something I will try out. But I have no idea what my incline asks are going to be because my trainers just shout a speed range and an incline at me. So I can’t use this function to set the incline by way of advancing laps.\nThe reason why I need track my incline this way is something you lovely folk know, Stryd can’t guess your incline on the treadmill and if I assume flat I leave a lot of effort unrecorded. My power curve has changed dramatically since I’ve started recording my inclines.\nWhat I want is a swipe-free interface something like this. I know it’s Frankenstein’s monster but I hope it gets the point across.\n\nAnother option would be 0-9 + an enter button. So you can go to 12% incline by pressing 1, 2, then enter.\nAnywho. That’s me for my very specific feature request in the guise of helping me safely run on a treadmill.\n(Cross posted from Stryd Club Forum, since I needed to host the video somewhere.)"
