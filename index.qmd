Hi, I'm Andrew - a Linked Data Expert who's spent the last decade turning messy data problems into elegant solutions across government and finance. I'm that rare breed who gets genuinely excited about metadata, believes good documentation is worth its weight in gold, and isn't afraid to tell you exactly why your data pipeline needs both. When I'm not evangelizing about linked data or writing Python, you'll find me at Barry's Bootcamp, because apparently, I enjoy bashing keyboards, smashing the treadmill, and throwing weights around - much like I enjoy throwing around strong opinions about data engineering best practices.

There's a lot to be said for a personal website without an all-consuming project. Over the last five years, I've built some cool things, but let me tell you about [csvcubed](blog/posts/2024-12-15-csvcubed.html) - a tool born from the trenches of government data engineering that turned a painful linked data publishing process into something actually manageable. It took us from wrestling with presentational spreadsheets to pumping out 5-Star Linked Data at 10x the speed. If you're into data engineering, linked data, or just enjoy stories about making complex things suck less, this one's for you.

New projects I want to highlight and other bragging rites coming soon?
