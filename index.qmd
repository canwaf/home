I don't have a cat, but I certainly enjoy throwing pet related questions at ChatGPT. This is a sample of level of nonsense I'm willing to put out into the world. Not quite proud of this, but certainly it's an index placeholder for the blog and about me pages.

### ChatGPT delivers a convocation speech for the business school

Oddly, this one provided more personality than the presiding dean. But bless the University of Sheffield for plouging through 200 awards in an hour. Certainly faster, though the content wasn't as interesting, as my experience with Open Unversity and now Dr. Ronan Keating on 16 May 2022.

`andrew fergusson:`
